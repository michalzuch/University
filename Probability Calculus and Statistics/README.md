# Probability Calculus and Statistics

Computer tasks from classes.

## Cards

We draw three cards from the deck of 52 cards. \
What is the probability that neither of them will be a club? \
The calculated probability is 0.587. \
After how many attempts it will be achieved?

## Poisson Generator

Write a pseudorandom number generator with Poissson distribution (e.g. for Î» = 4) based on the algorithm given in the lecture. \
Using it to generate N pseudorandom numbers, find their probability distribution and compare (on the graph) with the expected distribution.

## Distribution Generator

Please complete the example discussed in the lecture (rotate the distribution function) and then write a pseudorandom number generator generating numbers with the probability density function being the sides of the trapezoid with vertices at points \
`(-1.0), (0.1 / 3), (2.1 / 3), (3.0)`. \
Using the drawn numbers, please draw a normalized histogram reflecting the "experimental" probability density function and compare it with the theoretical one. \
Do this comparison for a different number (e.g. 103, 105) of random numbers.
