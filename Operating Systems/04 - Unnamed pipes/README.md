## Task instructions

### Task 1. Unnamed pipes

Implement the Producer and Consumer problem with unnamed UNIX pipes. To demonstrate that there has been no loss or multiplication of the goods, let the Producer take the raw material (e.g. portions of bytes) from the text file storage.txt and insert it as goods into the stream, and let the Consumer place the goods downloaded from the stream in clipboard.txt.
