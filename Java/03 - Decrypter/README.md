# Decrypter

## Task instructions

A hypothetical "Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science" conducts internal correspondence in encrypted form. The cipher is simple - one letter of the alphabet is replaced with a single character (not necessarily a letter). To crack the code (at least partially) you receive an encrypted message in which there is (almost) for sure the full name of the Faculty, spelled as "Wydzia≈Ç Fizyki, Astronomii i Informatyki Stosowanej" (without the quotation marks). However, people are only human and can be wrong - in message there may not be information about the name of the Faculty.
